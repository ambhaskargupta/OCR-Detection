# OCR-Detection

# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) System

## Introduction

This project focuses on building an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately recognize and classify characters in images.

## Key Components and Steps

**Dataset:** The project utilizes the "Standard OCR Dataset" containing a variety of characters for training and testing.

**CNN Model:** A custom CNN model is constructed using layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense.

**Transfer Learning:** To enhance performance, transfer learning is employed using the pre-trained VGG16 model.

**Evaluation:** The performance of both models is evaluated using metrics like loss and accuracy.

**Real-World Application:** The project demonstrates a real-world application by detecting and recognizing text in an image.


## Results

- The project achieved 96% Accuracy on the test dataset.
- Visualizations of training history and model performance are included in the notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of CNNs and transfer learning for OCR. It provides a foundation for further development in text extraction and automation.

## Potential Improvements

- Explore different CNN architectures and hyperparameter optimization.
- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- Integrate language models for enhanced word-level recognition.
